# Shaastra-IITM-Micro-Mouse-Maze


Shaastra is the Techfest conducted by IIT Madras.
we participated in Micro Mouse maze 2019 and 2020.
The problem statement wants us to build a compact robot which can goto the centre of the maze in shortest path and time.
we used flood fill algorithm and PID Control to solve the maze smoothly and efficiently.
we used ultrasonic sensors to sense the walls and encoders to know how far it has moved and we fed this data into flood fill algotithm and PID.
